The project portal consists of various work surfaces, which determine the available contexts that can be selected within the portal. The administration tool enables the creation of different work surfaces, but this functionality is limited to portal administrators due to the likelihood of requiring coding skills.

Each work surface defines one or multiple contexts that can be utilized. The responsibility of onboarding these contexts lies with the portal administrator.

Once a context is successfully onboarded, it becomes available for application onboarding. Each application needs to be onboarded to each applicable context. The portal provides functionality to add applications to multiple contexts or to all available contexts.

The application onboarding process ensures that the underlying data is fully compatible with the given application. Both the application administrator and the portal administrator are authorized to perform this task.
